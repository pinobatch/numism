Is it a platformer game?  Is it a test ROM?  Is it a repo I'll just

If you're curious
-----------------
The Game Boy version has at least [30 coins](docs/gb_coins.md).
There is also an interactive [exerciser](gameboy/exercise/README.md)
used for hardware and emulator behavior testing.
Building them requires RGBDS 0.6.1 or later, Python 3, and Pillow
(Python Imaging Library).

The NES version has at least [12 coins](docs/nes_coins.md).
Building it requires cc65, Python 3, and Pillow
(Python Imaging Library).
