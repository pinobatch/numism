; This NMI handler is good enough for a simple "has NMI occurred?"
; vblank-detect loop.  But sometimes there are things that you always
; want to happen every frame, even if the game logic takes far longer
; than usual.  These might include music or a scroll split.  In these
; cases, you'll need to put more logic into the NMI handler.

; A null IRQ handler that just does RTI is useful to add breakpoints
; that survive a recompile.  Set your debugging emulator to trap on
; reads of $FFFE, and then you can BRK $00 whenever you need to add
; a breakpoint.
;
; But sometimes you'll want a non-null IRQ handler.
; On NROM, the IRQ handler is mostly used for the DMC IRQ, which was
; designed for gapless playback of sampled sounds but can also be
; (ab)used as a crude timer for a scroll split (e.g. status bar).

  ; with a scrolling playfield and a still status bar, it's used to
