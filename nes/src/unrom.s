; Each bank has 16384 bytes: 16368 for you to use as you wish and
; 16 for a piece of code that puts the mapper in a predictable state.
; This code needs to be repeated in all the banks because we don't
; necessarily know which bank is switched in at power-on or reset.
;
; On most discrete logic mappers (AOROM 7, BNROM 34, GNROM 66, and
; Crazy Climber UNROM 180), writing a value with bits 5-0 true
; (that is, $3F, $7F, $BF, $FF) switches in the last PRG bank, but
; it has to be written to a ROM address that has the same value.
