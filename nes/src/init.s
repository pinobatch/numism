vwait1:

  bpl vwait1      ; stable.  Wait for the first frame's vblank.

  ; We have about 29700 cycles to burn until the second frame's
  ; vblank.  Use this time to get most of the rest of the chipset
  ; into a known state.

  ; Most versions of the 6502 support a mode where ADC and SBC work
  ; with binary-coded decimal.  Some 6502-based platforms, such as
  ; Atari 2600, use this for scorekeeping.  The second-source 6502 in
  ; the NES ignores the mode setting because its decimal circuit is
  ; dummied out to save on patent royalties, and games either use
  ; software BCD routines or convert numbers to decimal every time
  ; they are displayed.  But some post-patent famiclones have a
  ; working decimal mode, so turn it off for best compatibility.

  ; There are "holy wars" (perennial disagreements) on nesdev over
  ; whether it's appropriate to zero out RAM in the init code.  Some
  ; anti-zeroing people say it hides programming errors with reading
  ; uninitialized memory, and memory will need to be initialized
  ; again anyway at the start of each level.  Others in favor of
  ; clearing say that a lot more variables need set to 0 than to any
  ; other value, and a clear loop like this saves code size.  Still
  ; others point to the C language, whose specification requires that
  ; uninitialized variables be set to 0 before main() begins.

vwait2:
  bit PPUSTATUS  ; After the second vblank, we know the PPU has
  bpl vwait2     ; fully stabilized.
  
  ; There are two ways to wait for vertical blanking: spinning on
  ; bit 7 of PPUSTATUS (as seen above) and waiting for the NMI
  ; handler to run.  Before the PPU has stabilized, you want to use
  ; the PPUSTATUS method because NMI might not be reliable.  But
  ; afterward, you want to use the NMI method because if you read
  ; PPUSTATUS at the exact moment that the bit turns on, it'll flip
  ; from off to on to off faster than the CPU can see.
