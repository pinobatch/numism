Race notes
==========

Trying to collect my notes on sapient species and ethnicities thereof
in the fantasy world where Numism takes place.  In rough order of
appearance:

Human
-----

Seen: Prologue

The dominant species of this world.  Mindy, Emily, Clem, and everyone
else in her school and village.  Until Mindy starts looking for
coins, she hasn't met anyone who talks and is not a human.

One difference from Earth humans is that 5-alpha-reductase 2
deficiency (5ARD) is more common.  Affected boys don't produce DHT,
causing them to be hard to tell from girls at birth.  Many children
learn their sex around age 12, when regular testosterone kicks in
and boys rapidly become more masculine-looking.

Howie in the city is also human, despite that he resembles a
"Gloworm" toy.  He has a mild form of mermaid syndrome, in which
the legs do not fully separate as a fetus.

Leporichaun
-----------

Seen: End of stage 1

Talking lagomorphs who squat-hop on their hind legs.

Leporichauns do not have "beans" (grip pads) on their hands and feet.
Some wear work gloves with finger pads that resemble beans.  When
among humans, some leporichauns wear a top hat to hide their ears.

Many leporichauns are in a religious organization "Faith Hop & Love"
that raises chickens for eggs, operates a chain of all-day breakfast
restaurants, and distributes gift baskets containing eggs, candy, and
tracts every spring.

Some leporichauns get expelled from the organization and have to
learn a different trade.  A "clurichaun" is one expelled for chronic
intoxication on alcohol or drugs.  A "March hare" is one expelled
for sexual harassment during leporichauns' breeding season, which
happens to coincide with the roughly 6-week closure of restaurants
in preparation for Resurrection Sunday when the gift baskets go out.

Legend has it that roughly two thousand years before the present,
the son of God in human form disrupted an outdoor market outside the
temple where a bunch of sellers were overcharging pilgrims.  One of
his followers turned him in afterward, and he was tried and executed
for blasphemy.  When he came back to life a few days later, he
emerged from his tomb, saw a buck rabbit, and blessed him with speech
and thought.  The rabbit's descendants went on to be fruitful and
multiply and found the Faith Hop & Love ministry by 300 years BP.

Duck
----

Seen: End of stage 2

Snowman
-------

Seen: End of stage 3

Snow people share an ancestor with humans.  They have no legs, pale
skin, white fur over most of their bodies, and long orange noses.
Their fur and fat layer make them tolerant of cold weather.

Because fur covers the naughty bits, many snow people go around
naked except for headgear, a scarf, mittens for walking, and two or
three studs inserted into piercings from the chest down to the navel.

Kangaroo
--------

Seen: City

Broonie
-------

Seen: City

Broonies are a sapient species of xerine (similar to marmots,
chipmunks, prairie dogs, and other ground squirrels).  Adults stand
about a yard (0.9 m) tall.

Broonies typically wear ragged, ankle-length, hooded robes with
numerous patches.  The robe (which is often not washed for weeks)
helps concentrate body scent through which broonies recognize one
another.  It's customary for a broonie to refuse gifts of clothes,
as it makes them think someone thinks they deserve pity, plus they
might be too itchy or not hold scent well.

You'll often find broonies in domestic service, either performing
household or farm tasks overnight for food payment or running the
local coin laundry.

Gnome
-----

Seen: City

Gnomes are an ethnicity of Nander, which are humans with Laron
syndrome that prevents cells from using growth hormone.

They typically wear a bright pointed cap.  Some point up, which one
gnome explained as "to block things that fall."  Others point to the
left and right sides.

Gnomes are known for their prowess with engineering and the skilled
trades.  In their homeland, they were enslaved as craftsmen for the
regime until they had enough abuse and left.  They still consider
themselves servants for one another and their neighbors.

They speak a language with words that one might call one and a half
syllables long, with a complex initial consonant cluster followed by
a vowel, off-glide, and one more consonant.  This bleeds over to
their Common accent as well, preferring "small words" that have one
syllable or can otherwise be squeezed into this template.  For
example, "someone" is pronounced "sm'wan", like "swan" with an extra
"w". They don't use "I" or "me" either, instead preferring "kñom"
which also means "servant" or "gnome".  This form of "meek talk" is
roughly analogous to how English puts "and I" or "and me" at the end
of a list or how southeast Asian languages avoid personal pronouns.

Other races
-----------

A short titled "[Cupcakes Cafe]" was produced by Riptide to promote
Radica's 2006 relaunch of Cupcakes, a line of scented dolls that
Tonka made from 1990 to 1993.  What caught my interest were these
beings with apparently no legs that dance and dine in air-cushion
vehicles shaped like hoop skirts that fold into a cupcake shape at
rest.  Most of the time, they hover with ground effect.  With effort,
they can dash forward (2:24, 3:26) or upward (2:38).  When forward
movement is disrupted by debris, they trip (2:33, 3:13).

Years later, Sunny Days Entertainment produced Cupcake Surprise dolls
and Christoy produced Mini Cupcake Princess dolls.  With over three
decades since the original introduction, any patent on the toy
concept will have expired.

The Cupcakes concept is vaguely similar to the "bell girl"
concept that I independently came up with in 2019.  One difference
is that bell girls have a pair of legs that need to be shielded
from the ACV exhaust, and the shield is so rigid that they have to
hop instead of walking, and they can make a deep ringing sound by
kicking the inside of the skirt after dashing upward.
