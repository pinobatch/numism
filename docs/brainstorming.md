Purpose
=======

There are two sides to every coin.

The game
--------
On the surface, Numism is a simple platformer game.  The object
is to proceed through the levels, collect all 100 coins, and buy the
Product.  A lot of coins will be out of reach until you pay the
characters you meet to teach you moves.

You only collect coins that you know are authentic.  If you grab a
coin and it just stops spinning, that means it's fake.  Stand in
front of a coin and press Up to view a description of what's wrong
with it.  Retrieving some coins requires digging by crouching on an
actuator and then standing back up.

### Movement upgrades

Early on, you can't die.  If you cannot cross an obstacle, you'll
just stop.  Buying upgrades helps you cross more obstacles and reach
more coins.

- **Before the first upgrade**  
  Move on ground, crouch, ascend one cell, descend two cells, ascend
  and descend ladders, collect coins, and view fake coins.
- **Court shoes** sold by (name missing) for 5 coins  
  Cross gaps of one cell, ascend two cells, and descend three cells.
  Ascend to hills behind you.
- **Hoop buoy** sold by (name missing) for 5 coins  
  Float across the surface of water and ascend one cell from water.

At this point, if you haven't hit any fakes, you'll have collected 30
coins and spent 10.  This leads into a big change for the game feel.

- **Clapper** sold by a kangaroo dressed as Spirou outside the hotel for 10 coins  
  A boot that covers both feet. After buying it, you are no longer
  as closely bound to the cell grid.  You can grab a bar and swing
  from it, either to get a boost or to emit a tone (I'm still looking
  for what that does).  In exchange, you can no longer walk.  Instead
  you hop like a kangaroo.  You can also fall, after which you are
  placed at the previous checkpoint.
- **Ground effect hovering** sold by (name missing) for 10 coins  
  Hover a couple pixels above the ground or water.  Jump height from
  ground increases as well to cross gaps of more cells.
- **Flight** sold by (name missing) for 10 coins

### Continue

The title screen has "Start" and "Continue" option.  "Continue" looks
for fake coins and lets you choose to start at any section with no
fake coins or the first section with at least one fake coin, having
all coins and upgrades from previous sections.

The tests
---------
Flip the coin over, and Numism is a test ROM.  Each coin represents
a behavior of a console visible to a running program, and each fake
coin represents an emulator's failure to accurately reproduce that
behavior.

In some versions, the ten coins reachable without an upgrade
represent fairly easy tests that a certain well-known emulator fails.

Coins reachable only by digging represent tests that take longer to
run.
