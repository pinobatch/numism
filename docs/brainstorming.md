Purpose
=======

There are two sides to every coin.

The game
--------
On the surface, Numism is a simple platformer game.  The object
is to proceed through the levels, collect all 100 coins, and buy the
Product.  A lot of coins will be out of reach until you pay the
characters you meet to teach you moves.

You only collect coins that you know are authentic.  If you grab a
coin and it just stops spinning, that means it's fake.  Stand in
front of a coin and press Up to view a description of what's wrong
with it.  Retrieving some coins requires digging by crouching on an
actuator and then standing back up.

### Movement upgrades

Early on, your movement is grid-aligned, as in so-called "cinematic"
platformers, and you can't die.  If you cannot cross an obstacle,
you'll just stop.  Buying upgrades helps you cross more obstacles
and reach more coins.

- **Before the first upgrade**  
  Move on ground, crouch, ascend one cell, descend two cells, ascend
  and descend ladders, collect coins, and view fake coins.
- **Sneakers** sold by a leporichaun (anthropomorphic rabbit
  shoemaker in 18th-century clothes) named (name missing) at an
  outdoor market for 5 coins  
  Cross gaps of one cell, ascend two cells, and descend three cells.
  Ascend to hills behind you.  
  Once you've paid, you can ask the leporichaun his life story.
  Dialogue tree options lead to the ministry he was born into, why he
  left the organization to become a solitary shoemaker, and what he
  thinks of clurichauns (ex-Easter bunnies who've fallen into
  alcoholism).
- **Hoop buoy** sold by a duck named (name missing) for 5 coins  
  Float across the surface of water and ascend one cell from water.

At this point, if you haven't hit any fakes, you'll have collected 30
coins and spent 10.  This leads into a big change for the game feel.

- **Clapper** sold by Roopert, a kangaroo dressed as Spirou,
  outside the hotel for 10 coins  
  A boot that covers both feet. After buying it, you are no longer
  as closely bound to the cell grid.  You can grab a bar and swing
  from it, either to get a boost or to emit a tone (I'm still looking
  for what that does).  In exchange, you can no longer walk.  Instead
  you hop like a kangaroo.  You can also fall, after which you are
  placed at the previous checkpoint.
- **Ground effect hovering** sold by (name missing) for 10 coins  
  Hover a couple pixels above the ground or water.  Jump height from
  ground increases as well to cross gaps of more cells.
- **Flight** sold by (name missing) for 10 coins

### Continue

The title screen has "Start" and "Continue" option.  "Continue" looks
for fake coins and lets you choose to start at any section with no
fake coins or the first section with at least one fake coin, having
all coins and upgrades from previous sections.

### Tropes in use

The concept of collecting coins in the game world and turning them in
for mobility upgrades that allow reaching more coins is reminiscent
of 1990s collectathon platformers.

The tests
---------
Flip the coin over, and Numism is a test ROM.  Each coin represents
a behavior of a console visible to a running program, and each fake
coin represents an emulator's failure to accurately reproduce that
behavior.  One may draw parallels to protection measures in
Sony's _Spyro: Year of the Dragon_ for PlayStation, where some
[eggs are missing] on an infringing copy.

See [What makes a good coin?] for what I'm aiming at.
