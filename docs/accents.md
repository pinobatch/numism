We can simulate Mindy's accent accommodation by writing the first few
sentences with eye dialect and then flip to standard spelling.

Gnomish
-------

Gritch and his friends and family are Gnomes, an ethnic group known
for short stature (about 1.1 to 1.2 metres adult height), pointed
caps, and skills at digging and tinkering.

The Gnomes you meet in the city speak Gnomish Creole, a language
that is somewhat mutually intelligible with English with some effort
on the listener's part.  Because Gnomish is so "thick" (different
from standard), it doesn't fade as thoroughly as some other accents.

Gnomish has its own phonology inspired by that of Austronesian
languages.  There is a strong tendency for Gnomish words to be one
syllable, or one and a half at most.  A word consists of up to three
consonants, a vowel, an optional off-glide, and one more consonant.
Because there are few constraints on what consonants can make up a
cluster, the initial cluster often ends up picking up an ultra-short
schwa, making the word technically an iamb.  The "ch" sound (`/tʃ/`
in IPA) is fairly common due to historic palatalization of `/t/` and
`/k/` sounds.

Some English words are adapted to Gnomish phonotactics, whilst
others are replaced entirely with words from the lands where Gnomes
originated (mostly represented by Khmer).

- **kñom**  
  Originally meant "servant" and still does in some contexts.  The
  Gnomes were servants of the privileged class of their homeland and
  would avoid first-person pronouns out of politeness.  Thus it came
  to mean "I", "me", or "of mine" after a noun, as well as "Gnome".
  The motto *kñom kñom kñom* can be translated as "I serve myself" or
  "a Gnome serves Gnomekind".
- **s'mone**  
  Contraction of "someone", pronounced like "swan" with an extra "m".
- **s'mting**  
  Contraction of "something" with the "m" briefly becoming syllabic.
- **a big one**  
  Idiom for "very big".  (Believed to have originated from a
  reanalysis when the Gnomes were migrating through an area whose
  word for "very" sounded like their word for "one".  Compare Khmer
  *muay* "one" to Spanish *muy* "very".)
