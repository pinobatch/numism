EXT. TRAILHEAD 1 - DAY

Halfway down the trail through the park, ten-year-old Mindy spots
a strange little being squatting behind a table.  He's 0.9 m tall
(when squatting) and wears a knee-length red coat over a vest and
knee breeches.  The skirt of his coat nearly reaches the ground while
he squats.  Initially he wears a top hat and a scarf over his nose
and mouth to hide that he's a leporichaun, or anthropomorphic rabbit.
(Draw comparisons to White Rabbit and Hatter from Alice in
Wonderland.)  Sitting on his table are a pair of shoes and a cash box;
next to it is a wagon full of shoe boxes.  Each box's lid has a
drawing of a dandelion.

MINDY
(to no one in particular)
I wish I had sneakers like that.

DANNY
For five coins, I can grant your wish!  Take off your shoes and
step on this ruler.

Mindy crouches for a few seconds to remove her school shoes and
steps onto a Brannock Device.

DANNY
Could you pull your skirt up?

Mindy lifts the front of her skirt a few pixels.  Danny looks at
the size of Mindy's foot on the ruler.

DANNY
I think I have that size with me.

Danny jumps to turn toward the wagon, looks at his stock, and faces
Mindy again.

DANNY
Try these shoes here.

Danny hands Mindy a box marked
"SPRING TIME BY DANDELION O'MALLOW, PRICE 5 COINS".
Mindy crouches for a few seconds to put on the sneakers.

MINDY
"Dandelion O'Mallow?"

DANNY
Aye, I made 'em miself.  Call me Danny.

MINDY
What's this in the box?  Looks like a brochure about Jesus.

DANNY
Tis.  I used to work for a gift basket company called
Faith Hop & Love.

MINDY
Don't think I've heard of 'em.

Danny begins to tell his life story while Mindy moves around to get a
feel for the shoes she's trying on.

DANNY
They sell baskets of coloured eggs, sweets, and tracts, packed with
fake grass.  Resurrection Sunday is their busiest day of the year
by far.  Our warren would bring hundreds of baskets to area children
on that day alone.

MINDY
Like the Easter Bunny?

Danny takes off his hat and lowers his scarf to reveal a pair of
long ears and a rabbit muzzle.

MINDY
That answers that.  Mom and dad'll have some explaining to do.

DANNY
I lost mi job over a wine habit.  After I got sober, I learned to
make shoes because paved roads tear up mi paws, and brand name shoes
don't come in mi size.  I'm torn on whether to try to get mi old
job back, as the shoe trade is helping me build mi pot of gold for
once I'm old.
So how do they fit?

MINDY
They feel a lot better than what I had on.  Here's the money.
These will hold together until I grow out of them, right?

DANNY
Never fear, lass.  Be sure to tell your friends that a leporichaun
granted you a wish today.
