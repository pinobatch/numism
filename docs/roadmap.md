Roadmap
=======

Each sprint is 12 items.  Not all are filled in, as some sprints
leave space for splitting up other tasks.

Continue
--------
"Continue" is a conventional test framework.  It runs the 10 tests
that make up a stage and displays their results.

1. Draw description of passed/failed test to window
2. Define test pattern for APU timer
3. Make instruction timer
4. Make mode 3 length measurer
5. Make OAM bug exerciser: fill OAM, wait for a mode, do inc/dec,
   read OAM.  Repeat for modes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
