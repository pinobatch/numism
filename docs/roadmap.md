Roadmap
=======

Each sprint is 12 items.  Not all are filled in, as some sprints
leave space for splitting up other tasks.

Continue
--------
"Continue" is a conventional test framework.  It runs the 10 tests
that make up a stage and displays their results.

1. Draw headings and test numbers
2. Draw all test names to $8400-$8DFF
3. Draw all test results (pass or fail)
4. Move cursor to test
5. Window slides in and out
6. Draw description of passed/failed test to window
7. Change between implemented stages (and redraw everything)
8. 
9. 
10. Make instruction timer
11. Make mode 3 length measurer
12. Make OAM bug exerciser: fill OAM, wait for a mode, do inc/dec,
    read OAM.  Repeat for modes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
