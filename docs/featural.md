The featural script
===================

After seeing a few signs (such as through Howie's quest line), Mindy
gets confused as to why she can't read any signs.  It turns out that
because residents of the city speak so many different languages,
signs in public places are written in a compromise alphabet called
"featural".

Featural is written from top to bottom.  Columns proceed from left to
right, as in Mongolian and Phags-pa.  In vertically restricted space,
it can be written with one column per syllable from left to right,
somewhat resembling Tibetan.  It's called "featural" because
consonant shapes are somewhat predictably related to their sound.

In general, a consonant's place of articulation is indicated at the
left and right sides.

- ⟨b p m f⟩ representing labial sounds /b p m f~ɸ/ have lines at
  left and right.
- ⟨d t n s⟩ representing alveolar sounds /d t n s/ are closed on
  the left and open to the right.
- ⟨g c ŋ h⟩ representing Velar sounds /g k ŋ x~h/ are closed on
  the right and open to the left.
- ⟨g' c' ñ h'⟩ representing post-alveolar or palatal sounds
  /dʒ~ɟ tʃ~c ɲ ʃ~ç/ are closed on the right and open to the left
  with a dot in the center for palatalization.

Manner of articulation is the lines at bottom.

- ⟨b d g⟩ representing voiced stops /b d g/ curve at the top and
  bottom, as with Latin O and C.
- ⟨p t k⟩ representing voiceless stops /p t k/ curve at the top and
  bottom and have an additional line across the top.  (Some languages
  realize this distinction less as voicing than as aspiration.)  The
  letter for `/t/` ends up looking like ⟨Ꞇ⟩, the insular form of
  Latin T.
- ⟨m n ŋ⟩ representing nasals /m n ŋ/ curve at the bottom, as with
  Latin J or U.
- ⟨f s h⟩ representing fricatives /f s h/ have a stroke across the
  center, as with Latin H.

Special cases:

- ⟨l⟩ representing /l/ resembles the Hangul jamo for the same sound,
  or a reversed Latin S.

Three basic vowel sounds have symbols:

- ⟨i⟩ representing /i~ɪ/ is a dot.  Its smallness is iconic of the
  high second formant.
- ⟨a⟩ representing /a~ɑ/ is a vertical stroke, iconic of an open
  mouth.
- ⟨u⟩ representing /u~ʊ/ is a horizontal stroke, iconic of a nearly
  closed mouth.

Other vowels are written with combinations of these:

- ⟨o⟩ representing /o/ is a ligature of ⟨au⟩ resembling an inverted
  Latin T.
- ⟨e⟩ representing /e/ is a vertical line to the left of a dot,
  conceptually ⟨a⟩ next to ⟨i⟩.
- ⟨i:⟩ representing English "long E" /ɪj/ is two dots side by side.

English makes contrasts that the original language for featural did
not.  Some of these are spelled with double letters; others are
ambiguous (or "[defective]".)

- Because ⟨f⟩ and ⟨s⟩ represent fricatives without respect to
  voicing, ⟨ff⟩ and ⟨ss⟩ are used in a few words to spell
  specifically voiceless /f/ and /s/.
- ⟨tf⟩ and ⟨df⟩ spell dental fricatives /θ/ and /ð/.
- ⟨e⟩ represents both short /ɛ/ and long /ej/.
- ⟨l⟩ represents both /l/ and /r/. Sometimes /r/ is spelled ⟨lu⟩.
- ⟨o⟩ represents short /ɔ/, and ⟨ou⟩ represents long /ow/ as in
  "rainbow".
