Game Boy Advance emulator testing
=================================

Blargg didn't make GBA tests analogous to the NES or GB tests.

- [gba-tests by jsmolka](https://github.com/jsmolka/gba-tests)
- endrift's [suite](https://github.com/mgba-emu/suite) (see also [forum post](https://forums.mgba.io/showthread.php?tid=18))

As with the Game Boy, I want to concentrate on no$gba for stage 1
and VBA and VBA-M for stage 2.  So the initial emulators under test
are slated to be no$gba, VBA, VBA-M, mGBA, and possibly higan.
