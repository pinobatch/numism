Howie is a preschool-aged street urchin in the City.  He wears a blue
hooded shirt over a green sleeping bag.  Because his legs developed
differently, instead of walking, he jumps (on a good day) or crawls
(on a bad day).  At night, he listens to lullabies on his music
player and uses a headlamp to see.

Unlike some of the earlier bosses, who are defeated with one
purchase, Howie's quest is a chain of fetch quests: 1🪙️ at fast food
restaurant Lottie's, 6🪙️ at discount grocery Seed, 1🪙️ at a coin
laundry, and 2🪙️ not yet determined.

Lottie's
--------

- Sector: Quick service restaurant
- Location: City
- Objective for boss: Howie
- Featural spelling: L-O-T-T-II-S

Lottie's is a quick-service restaurant chain selling hamburgers.
Its mascot is Lottie, a girl with (legally distinct) pigtails.
It calls its combos Square Meals because their food doesn't cut
corners in freshness.

Lottie was first drawn as one of the [Popslide Girls] in
January 2017, an attempt at mascots for a software library.
In-universe, *Popslide Girls* is a children's book series about a
group of four preteen girls who go on adventures around the local
playground: Lottie and her friends Darcy, Gileina, and Civona.
It's quite a bit less fantastic than McDonaldland, and even though
it is an obvious corporate tie-in, it has fans as devoted to its
lore as *My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic* had in the real world.
When Lottie's isn't running a toy promotion, its Kids' Meal
comes with a booklet containing an excerpt from the next
*Popslide Girls* book.

When Mindy meets preschool street urchin Howie, he's hungry.
However, Mindy has been cautioned against giving money to homeless
people, instead donating in kind.  After Mindy buys Howie a kids'
meal from Lottie's and an order of nuggets for herself (1🪙️), they
eat together and read the *Popslide Girls* book together.  The rest
of the shopping list unlocks as Mindy helps Howie climb Abraham
Maslow's [hierarchy of needs].

Seed
----

- Sector: Discount grocery focusing on private-label products;
  limited garden supplies and impulse buy merchandise
- Location: City
- Objectives for boss: Howie
- Featural spelling: S-II-D

Seed is a discount grocery store chain modeled after ALDI Süd,
with a low-frills aesthetic.  Most shelves have store-brand food.
The ImPulse aisle (from "impulse buy" and "pulse" meaning legume)
has a weekly rotating assortment of other merchandise.  The seasonal
shelf between ImPulse and fresh produce has a more slowly rotating
assortment, usually gardening supplies (to be modeled after
Rachael S. Johnston's review of [Gardenline gear] and explanation of
[seasonal items]).

The logo of Seed resembles a seedling (🌱, U+1F331) stylized to
resemble the letter S in featural (which resembles the right curly
bracket middle piece ⎬ U+23AC).

After keeping a 1 cio coin (value 1/40 of a coin) from change at
Lottie's, Mindy can pay the cart deposit at Seed.  Mindy buys these
for Howie:

- A box of 10 meal bars (1🪙️) from grain snacks aisle
- Batteries for his headlamp and music player (1🪙️) from checkout
- Spare undershirt (1🪙️) from ImPulse
- Backpack (2🪙️) from ImPulse
- Sleeping mat (1🪙️) from ImPulse

Note: Unlike real-life ALDI, Seed sells alkaline batteries.

Money Laundry
-------------

(Name is tentative)

- Sector: Pay laundry
- Location: City
- Objective for boss: Howie

Mindy buys a stored-value card (1🪙️) and washes and dries Howie's
clothes.
