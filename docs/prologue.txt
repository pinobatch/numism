We might set this up with a conversation in a school cafeteria
inspired by [chaseseq's interpretation] of "The Reflex" by
Duran Duran.

The next day, Mindy was eating lunch with her classmate Clem.  Mindy
finished chewing one of her chicken strips, turned toward Clem, and
said "Clem?"

Clem still had a mouth full of macaroni. "Yeah?"

"I saw the book for this game Emily has.  I really want that game,
but my mom and dad won't buy it for me."

"Don't know what to tell you, Mindy."

They ate the rest of their meals over the next few minutes.  The two
stood up to carry their plates to the wash bin when Clem remembered
something.  "I heard this song on the radio.  It's about a boy whose
dad plays cards too much.  To help mom make ends meet, the boy has to
go to the park at night and look for things to sell."

Mindy briefly froze in thought.  "That gives me an idea!"
