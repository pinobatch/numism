Village
=======

The story of Numism begins in Mindy's home village.

The scenario
------------

Ten-year-old Mindy sees classmate Emily reading a video game manual
at recess and gets jealous.  When Mindy gets home, she asks her
parents to buy her a game console.  Parents tell her they don't have
the money, suggest that she search for loose change in the city park,
and warn her about counterfeit money.

She ends up spending her money on everything but the game console,
such as athletic shoes and a pool float, in hopes that it'll help her
reach more money.

Player characters
-----------------

Mindy Beageonton, the player character, is naturally blonde, dyes her
hair green, and wears it in a ponytail.  Emily F. MacProut, her
rival, keeps her red hair in a bun.  (Don't know yet if the bun will
be wrapped in cloth.)

David Narter in *Don't Name Your Baby* describes the names of the
characters as follows:

- Mindy  
  Fortunately, Mindy's first boyfriend will be a computer whiz.
  Unfortunately, the couple will be called Dork and Mindy.
- Emily  
  A mushy, meek, and furry name that even kittens find nauseating.
  She's not going to be a baby forever.

I'm deliberately avoiding referring to the "stranger danger" hysteria
of the 1980s and 1990s that has been seen to slow children's social
development. (See "Why talking to strangers can make us smarter" by
Joe Keohane.)

Classmates
----------

Mindy and Emily are the only ones in class with a distinctly feminine
name.  The rest of them have androgynous names for a couple reasons.
In-universe, some families have a family history of ambiguous
presentation at birth (5-ARD) and therefore give their children
names that match either gender.

Out-of-universe, it's that their gender doesn't matter for the story.
Compare "[Guidelines for Inclusive Language]", published by
Linguistic Society of America in 2016, which recommends:

> In glossing forms from a language that does not explicitly mark
> masculine gender, use a form such as 3ps (third person singular) in
> place of a glossed gendered English pronoun such as he to avoid the
> introduction of gender-specificity. The use of ‘gender-neutral’
> names such as Chris, Dana, Kim, Lee, and Pat can help avoid
> stereotyping either males or females.

Some names that may be used:

Alex, Ash, Avery, Bryn,
Cameron, Casey, Charlie, Chris, Clem, Connie, Cory,
Danny, Drew, Gabby, Hayden, Jackie, Jamie, Jean, Jordan,
Leslie, Mel, Morgan, Nicky, Pat, Pepper, Reggie, Robin,
Sam, Skylar, Taylor, Tracy

We avoid some names in unisex lists on the web for strong association
with individuals or fictional characters of a particular gender:

- Briar is in *Thwaite*, named after the *Sleeping Beauty* character.
- Hunter evokes the masculinity of Hunter Hearst Helmsley ("Triple H"
  for short) in the wrestling promotion WWE.  In addition, both
  Sydney and Hunter are linked to negative reviews by [drewskyh] and
  [Julian Hill] of a Super NES game with lo-fi graphics.
- Kirby is a famous Nintendo character, described with "he" in all
  *Super Smash Bros.* games, and Nintendo is known for lawyering up.
- Logan evokes the masculinity of Wolverine from *X-Men* and the
  short lifespan in *Logan's Run*.  He is also one of the few
  characters in Jay at Play's Flip Zee Girls/Flipkins toy line not
  to use "she".
- Madison and Ariel were popularized by Disney films about merpeople,
  and Disney is known for lawyering up even more than Nintendo.

Limit mention of this androgyny to a throwaway bit about a classmate
or two being eager to know whether they'll be a man or woman when
they grow up.  Don't let it become the main attraction like the
["Pat" sketches] from NBC's *Saturday Night Live* in the early 1990s.
The Americanism "kids" to refer to children is allowed and can be
explained in another throwaway bit about it referring to goats and
people the way "kittens" refers to both rabbits and cats.

The school uniform for both boys and girls is a school-issued vest
and hoop skirt over whatever clothes the student already owns.
The skirt was introduced to deter disease transmission and unwelcome
touching.  Some students take off the skirt after the school day;
others (such as Mindy) continue to wear it.

Locations
---------

Mindy's adventure begins in a park along a trail.  The trail has
three segments:
from the playground to a trading post,
from there to a pond beside a river with a bridge out,
and from there to a strip mall with a general store and a bus stop.
Each has ten coins to find.

Buses are conventionally 2.5 m by 2.5 m by 12.5 m.  At the 1 m = 16
pixels rough scale of the game, this amounts to the bus being drawn
as a 40 by 40 pixel square.
