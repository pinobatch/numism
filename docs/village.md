Village
=======

The story of Numism begins in Mindy's home village.

The scenario
------------

Ten-year-old Mindy sees classmate Emily reading a video game manual
at recess and gets jealous.  When Mindy gets home, she asks her
parents to buy her a game console.  Parents tell her they don't have
the money, suggest that she search for loose change in the city park,
and warn her about counterfeit money.

She ends up spending her money on everything but the game console,
such as athletic shoes and a pool float, in hopes that it'll help her
reach more money.

Player characters
-----------------

Mindy Beageonton, the player character, is naturally blonde, dyes her
hair green, and wears it in a ponytail.  Emily F. MacProut, her
rival, keeps her red hair in a bun.  (Don't know yet if the bun will
be wrapped in cloth.)

David Narter in *Don't Name Your Baby* describes the names of the
characters as follows:

- Mindy  
  Fortunately, Mindy's first boyfriend will be a computer whiz.
  Unfortunately, the couple will be called Dork and Mindy.
- Emily  
  A mushy, meek, and furry name that even kittens find nauseating.
  She's not going to be a baby forever.

I'm deliberately avoiding referring to the "stranger danger" hysteria
of the 1980s and 1990s that has been seen to slow children's social
development. (See "Why talking to strangers can make us smarter" by
Joe Keohane.)

Classmates
----------

Mindy and Emily are the only ones in class with a distinctly feminine
name.  The rest of them have androgynous names for a couple reasons.
In-universe, some families have a family history of ambiguous
presentation at birth (5-ARD) and therefore give their children
names that match either gender.  Out-of-universe, it's that their
gender doesn't matter for the story.

Some names that may be used:

Alex, Ash, Avery, Bryn,
Cameron, Casey, Charlie, Chris, Clem, Connie, Cory,
Danny, Drew, Gabby, Hayden, Jackie, Jamie, Jean, Jordan,
Leslie, Mel, Morgan, Nicky, Pat, Pepper, Reggie, Robin,
Sam, Skylar, Taylor, Tracy

Some names in unisex lists on the web are avoided to avoid confusion:

- Briar is in *Thwaite*, named after the *Sleeping Beauty* character.
- Hunter evokes the masculinity of WWE's Triple H.  In addition, both
  Sydney and Hunter are linked to negative reviews by [drewskyh] and
  [Julian Hill] of a Super NES game with lo-fi graphics.
- Kirby is a Nintendo character, and Nintendo is known for lawyering
  up.
- Logan is a Flipkins character appearing in Friendly House.
- Madison and Ariel were popularized by Disney films about merpeople,
  and Disney is known for lawyering up even more than Nintendo.

The school uniform for both boys and girls is a school-issued vest
and hoop skirt over whatever clothes the student already owns.
The skirt was introduced to deter disease transmission and unwelcome
touching.  Some students take off the skirt after the school day;
others (such as Mindy) continue to wear it.

Locations
---------

Mindy's adventure begins in a park along a trail.  The trail has
three segments: from the playground to a trading post, from there
to a river with a bridge out, and from there to a strip mall with a
general store and a bus stop.
