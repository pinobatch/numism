Game Boy instruction exerciser
==============================

This is a small ROM used to interactively test CPU instruction
behavior in a Game Boy emulator, even one without a debugger.
Use it to demonstrate half-carry and DAA behavior differences.

* `INST`: Edit up to 6 bytes of machine code
* `EXEC`: Set to `OFF` (don't run), `PRESS A` (run when A is pressed
  and released), or `AUTO` (run after each digit change)
* `AF`, `BC`, `DE`, `HL`, `SP`: Set registers before execution, and
  see results after execution
* After `AF` result word is `ZNHC`, with space written instead if
  flag is clear

The instruction is placed at $C000, to be followed by
`NOP NOP JP after_inst`.
