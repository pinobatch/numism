Open-air market
===============

Stage 1 ends at a flea market at the east end of the park, just
before it turns into a trail through the woods.  Some vendors at the
market are professional vendors of new goods; others are individuals
seeking to unload their household junk.  Mindy buys a pair of
athletic shoes from an NPC there.

A [post by swillden] on Slashdot user claims unlike the USA, Germany
doesn't really have "yard sales" or "[garage sales]."  Instead,
non-professional sellers rent a table at a [flea market] (German:
*Flohmärkt*) to sell used household goods, and the market's promoter
provides electronic payment processing.

In the Middle Ages, a "[town]" enjoyed the right to host a weekly
open-air market for surrounding villages.  Having historic structures
like a "[market cross]" (a gazebo used as the information booth of a
[market square]) could make a game's world look lived-in.

To write the dialogue of non-professional vendors, it'd help to
understand how much they sacrificed for a table.  A gbdev user from
Poland mentioned a weekly farmer's market where can set up a 1.5 m
long table for about 15 minutes' wages or a 12 m² tent for about a
half hour's wages.  (This is town price; rent in big cities is about
twice that.)  In a game with graphics close to 16 pixels per metre,
those might fit in a convenient 32-pixel or 64-pixel space.

Users in gbdev and NESdev mentioned the [10th Anniversary Stadium],
a sport stadium that doubled as a market square.  An annual flea
market in Fort Wayne, Indiana, likewise occupies the outfield of
Lawton Park's ball diamonds.

Some markets have vendors selling used goods.  Others, such as [YLNI]
in Fort Wayne, Indiana, are "producer-only" for professional vendors.

Some vendors are touring vendors, who show up at a particular market
only once a month or less often.  This could explain Mindy not having
seen this particular shoemaker before, even if she had been to the
market before with her parents.
