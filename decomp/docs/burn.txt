Editor
------

- Build a struct representing the entire view state
- Draw the list of available blocks (with 3 rows of Markov below)
- Choose compact or Markov-preview block palette
- Middle click drag to scroll focused camera
- Hit-test mouse against a map
- Place a block
- Choose block to place from block palette
- Choose block to place from map (eyedropper)
- Display with or without Markov chains
- Display with no grid, grid on explicit blocks, or grid on all blocks
- Insert columns
- Undo and redo
- Save
- Open
- Convert editor format to game format
- Calculate time since last save when asking to save changes

Camera behavior
---------------

- Track drawn area and vicinity separately to draw one half column
  at a time instead of 2 to 3
- Load more than one map

Mindy graphics
--------------

- draw ladder climbing modeled on Peach
- walk tweening
- commission a less ugly drawing of Mindy for the title screen

### borderflash

Visual test of quirks of Super Game Boy fade animation.

- tile 0 is transparent and used for playfield
- tile 0 is opaque and tile 2 is used for playfield
- tile 0 is transparent and tile 2 is used for playfield
- tile 0 is checkerboard and tile 2 is used for playfield
- tiles 10-1F use the game window palette (0) instead of one of the
  fading palettes (4-6)

### trn-stress

Visual tests to rule out shortcuts taken by a Super Game Boy emulator
when receiving a border or set of 45 attribute shapes.  They should
load correctly even if:

- the border is presented as usual (SCX=SCY=0, WX=FF, BGP=E4, base $8000)
- first 2 KiB of payload is at $9000, not $8000
- tilemap is scrolled by 1 row and column (SCX=SCY=8)
- 16-byte chunks of payload are in reverse order (tilemap FF-00)
- payload is bit inverted (BGP 0123)
- payload is byte swapped (BGP 3120)
- every row is offset by 8 more pixels (SCX raster)
- rows are in reverse order (SCY raster)
- right half of tilemap is in the window (WX=7, WY=0)
- part of tilemap is in the OAM (OBP0=E4)
- bytes are in reverse order (SCY raster and BGP=3120)
- payload is shifted left 1 bit (SCX=1)
